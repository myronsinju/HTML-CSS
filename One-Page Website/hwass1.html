<!-- Hi Myron,

Your submission is missing the following requirements:

1. The Light-blue background color is not displaying correctly.

3. The Title element is not functioning correctly.

5. The URL to The Tech Academy's website is not functioning correctly.

6. The Tech Academy Logo is out of proportion. It should be resized with a width of 600px and a height of 300px.

7. The Tech Academy Logo needs to display a red, dashed border, two pixels in thickness.

8. The Heading 3 element, "Have you seen The Tech Academy's Student Orientation video?" is not being centered correctly.

9. The embedded Youtube video isn't displaying.

Please resubmit this drill when all these requirements are added. I recommend creating an HTML file so you can test the code to make sure things work as expected. If you would some help with this drill please let us know.
